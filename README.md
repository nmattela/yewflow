# Yewflow

A library inspired by [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev), but made for Yew.

It is not a perfect copy, nor does it include all the features that React Flow has.

The current features are:
- A fully-functional panel that can be dragged and zoomed in.
- Nodes that can be dragged around and customized to your liking.
- Straight edges that can be customized to your liking.

Some major features that are missing:
- There is only a single edge type (straight).
- There is no default styling for nodes or edges. One must be provided by the user.

To get started, I recommend you check out the example in the [examples](examples) folder.
